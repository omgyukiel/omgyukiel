## 👋 Hi there, I'm Kenny  

I'm a software engineer who loves building backend systems — and when I’m not getting paid, I’m tinkering with side projects inspired by my favorite games.

I used to rank in the top 0.01% in a couple of the most popular esports titles; somewhere in the middle of college I lost interest and instead redirected that same energy into programming. In that sense I see programming in the same light, where I'm figuring out the "meta" and grinding for mastery. I'm not at a point where I consider myself even decent at anything yet (and that's a high standard), but I find significant satisfaction out of being a white belt again ^^

### 🎮 What I'm Working On  
At work I'm most involved in backend with the MSFT ecosystem (C#/.NET) as well as React/TypeScript; outside of that I'm currently building side projects inspired by games I love — I’ll share them once they’re close to ready 😅
