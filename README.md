## 👋 Hi there, I'm Kenny  

I'm a **software engineer** who loves building **backend systems** — and when I’m not getting paid to play with Microsoft’s ecosystem, I’m usually tinkering with side projects inspired by my favorite games.  

I used to rank in the **top 0.01%** of a few competitive games — now I’m channeling that same obsessive energy into becoming **technically elite** in programming.

### 🎮 What I'm Working On
