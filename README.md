## 👋 Hi there, I'm Kenny  

I'm a software engineer who loves building **backend systems** — and when I’m not getting paid, I’m usually tinkering with side projects inspired by my favorite games.

### 🧠 Fun Fact  
I used to rank in the **top 0.01%** of a few competitive games — now I'm channeling that same energy into programming. I don't even consider myself decent at anything yet but I'm trying a lot of things with a competitive approach: breaking it down, understanding the meta, and grinding for mastery.
