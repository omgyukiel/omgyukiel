## 👋 Hi there, I'm Kenny  

I'm a software engineer who loves building backend systems — and when I’m not getting paid, I’m tinkering with side projects inspired by my favorite games.

I don't even consider myself decent at anything yet but I'm trying a lot of things with a competitive approach: breaking it down, understanding the meta, and grinding for mastery.

### 🧠 Fun Facts  
I used to rank in the **top 0.01%** of a few competitive games — now I'm channeling that same energy into programming. 

Right now my interests are leading me to Golang and by circumstance I've been working a lot in .NET. Despite it not being a long-term goal I have a ton of fun building websites too.
