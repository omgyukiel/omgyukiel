## Hi there 👋
I'm Kenny, I'm a write backend systems in .NET and when I'm not getting paid to play with Microsoft toys I like making things related to games. I used to be ranked in the top .01% in a lot of competitive games and now I'm too old so I'm working on being technically deep in programming too :) 

Currently am working on making side projects related to some video games I love, hope to update when it's ready to show!

### Currently my interests are
- distributed systems
- golang

### Books I'm reading
- Designing Data Intensive Applications
