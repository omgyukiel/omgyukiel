## 👋 Hi there, I'm Kenny  

I'm a software engineer who loves building backend systems.

I used to rank in the top 0.01% in a couple of the most popular esports titles; somewhere in the middle of college I lost interest and instead redirected that same energy into programming.

## What I'm doing
I'm currenlty working at Oracle Health AI for the Forward Engineerinig team where I develop and deploy agents --- my current interest reside in learning more about agent development, distributed systems, and scaling backend services.
